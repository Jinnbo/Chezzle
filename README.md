- The motivation behind this project was simple: I wanted to enhance my chess abilities through practice and problem-solving. As an avid chess enthusiast, I realized that solving puzzles is an excellent way to sharpen one's skills, improve tactical vision, and deepen one's understanding of the game.

- However, I encountered a common obstacle while trying to access chess puzzles. Popular chess platforms like Chess.com offer a limited number of free puzzles each day, and I craved a more diverse and extensive collection to challenge myself with.


- To overcome this challenge and create a solution for chess enthusiasts like me, I embarked on a journey to compile a comprehensive collection of chess puzzles. I scraped the internet and gathered over 3,000,000 unique puzzles from various online sources. This vast assortment covers a wide range of difficulty levels, from beginner to grandmaster, ensuring that there's something for chess players of all skill levels.
